Carousels Wordpress Plug-in
===========================

by Simon Baier

Add carousels similar to the one on cnet.com homepage to any Wordpress blog. Each carousel has one or more slides. A slide contains a background image, a thumbmail, a heading, some paragraph of text and some short text meant to convey "read more". At any given time, one slide is displayed along with a panel of all the thumbnails of all slides.

When the page loads, the carousel is in a slide show mode displaying one slide after the other. When the user hovers the mouse over the thumbnail, the slide corresponding to the thumbnail is displayed. Slide show stops as soon as user starts interacting. All transitions are smooth using opacity blending. A left and right arrow buttons next to the thumbnails are also available to navigate the slides. Clicking on a slide navigates to the page corresponding to the slide.
